# Personal-Webpage-2
Small personal webpage built using the Next.js framework, configured to use app-router and TypeScript.
This web app is configure to be deployed as static pages on github pages.

### Usage
To run in development mode use
```shell
npm run dev
```
For deployment just push to the main branch and the github action will take care of the rest.

### Enviroment variables
To run the web app you need to supply an
`.env.*` file with the variables. Optionally you can
supply one for `production`and another one for `development`.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_IMAGE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_LINEKDIN_IMAGE_URL
GITHUB_USER_LINK
GITHUB_USERNAME
PUBLIC_SITE_URL
HOME_PAGE
```

### Deployment
The web app is deployed using GitHub Pages. The deployment is using GitHub Actions to build the web app and push the build to pages. 

The site automatically rebuilds and redeploys:
- When changes are pushed to the `main` branch
- Daily at 3 AM UTC (to pick up new projects from GitHub automatically)
- Manually via the Actions tab (workflow_dispatch)

# Next.js boilerplate documentation

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
